            <p>When it gets cold and your furnace kicks on, it sends dust, mold spores, and insect parts into the air.
              They can get into your nose and launch a reaction.

              Some common indoor allergy triggers are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dust mites . These microscopic bugs flourish in mattresses and bedding. When their droppings and remains become airborne, they can cause allergy symptoms.</li>
                <li>Mold. This fungus thrives in damp, humid areas such as basements and bathrooms. When mold spores get into the air, they can trigger allergy symptoms.</li>

          <div class="content">
            <p>Allergy symptoms caused by dust, pollen, or mold include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coughing</li>
              <li>Dark circles under the eyes</li>
              <li>Itchy eyes and nose</li>
              <li>Runny nose</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How can you tell whether your symptoms are from a cold, the flu, or allergies? A cold usually doesn't last for more than 10 days. Allergies can linger for weeks or even months. Also, colds and flu sometimes have a fever and aches and pains, which don’t usually happen with allergies.</p>
